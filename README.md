# SP-Notes
Shun's Public Notes for System Programming in Fall 2025

## Notes Remark
Due to being busy, I do not really have time to create presentable to public notes for SP weekly.

I will only upload notes of several weeks at once in one document during midterms and finals. Understandably, I will focus more on exam adjacent information and not code syntax.

I may create a markdown document I update weekly for relevant syntax information outside of these notes, for convenience when you need to search for syntax when coding.
