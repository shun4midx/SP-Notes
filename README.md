# SP-Notes
Shun's Public Notes for System Programming in Fall 2025

## Notes Remark
Due to being busy, I do not really have time to create presentable to public notes for SP weekly.

I will only upload notes of several weeks at once in one document during midterms and finals. Understandably, I will focus more on exam adjacent information and not code syntax.

Note that the uploaded versions contain mistakes. I'll leave it to you all to fix them, but I definitely notice some mistakes in my current versions. DM me if you find the mistakes I guess, haha. I decided to not upload my final version of my Final notes as it is more personal, so sorry for the commit.
